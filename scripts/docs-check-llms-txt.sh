# scripts/docs-check-llms-txt.sh — semantic check for the generated
# /llms.txt (https://llmstxt.org/) against its source of truth,
# docs/data/nav.yml (see docs/layouts/home.llms.txt and docs/STYLE.md
# "llms.txt"). A plain `hugo` build succeeding is not enough: a broken
# groups[].items traversal (or similar template regression) can
# silently drop entries — e.g. dropping from 99 to 64 with the
# groups-only "Built-in Tools" and "Resources" sections left empty —
# while the build itself stays green. This script builds the site and
# asserts the *content* of public/llms.txt matches nav.yml exactly:
# same sections, same order, same titles, same count, every link
# matching nav.yml's URL at the SAME position (not merely "absolute
# under the site baseURL", which a wrong-but-same-origin or duplicated
# link would also satisfy), and every entry carrying a non-empty
# (whitespace-only counts as empty) `: note`.
#
# Each entry's rendered URL is compared against the expected absolute
# URL derived from nav.yml at the SAME index (BASE_URL joined with the
# nav url) - a prefix-only check ("starts with BASE_URL") would pass
# even if every entry rendered the identical link.
#
# The expected (title, url) list is built by parsing nav.yml
# STRUCTURALLY, section by section (items first, then groups[].items),
# not by independent greps over title:/url: lines in physical file
# order: the template always emits items before groups regardless of
# which key comes first in a section's YAML block, so a physical-order
# grep would silently mismatch for a groups-before-items section.
#
# Bash-3.2-compatible (no mapfile/associative arrays), matching
# scripts/workflow-lint.sh's portability note, so it also runs under
# macOS's default /bin/bash.
